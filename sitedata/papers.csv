qa-ViH3hESQ,Development of a machine learning aided log end biometric system, Njabulo Mncwane | Hermann Tapamo,"The objective of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of developing a log end biometric system with the use of machine learning-based and computer vision model. To achieve this, a CNN based on the U-Net model architecture is trained to extract the log of focus from images. A Siamese network is utilized to estimate the similarity between any two segmented log-ends. The U-Net-based segmentation model and Siamese models achieved 98% and 92% accuracy, respectively. The work carried out in this project proves that the use of machine learning models as a back end for a log end biometric system is viable.",MTAnalytics,exhibition,1
0ZG8kS4c7iU,Measuring the Impact of Law Research in SA Courts,Danie Ungerer | Hillion Mngomezulu,"The are many ways of measuring the impact of academic research in other academic research.  Academic research impact measurements include citation count measures like the h-index.  The Faculty of Law at the University of Pretoria, however, wants to understand the impact of law research in the courts of South Africa. The projects aim at modelling the ""interactions"" through the application of graph theory. Graph theory is the study of graphs representing mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects as part of a network. A network comprises many links (edges or ties) and objects (nodes or vertices). This structure allows for the application of Social Network Analysis (SNA) as an applied method of graph theory. SNA enables the analysis of objects (nodes or vertices) in a network at micro level as well as the patterns of relationships (the entire network structure) at a macro level. The project's main aim is to firstly define an appropriate measure for law research impact from node-level network analysis. Further to defining ""impact measure"" as part of the assignment, this project will also aim to identify law research with high impact in South African courts.",WirelessFidelity,exhibition,2
_a-Xb1Jg3cM,Enabling weather based decision making for forestry research and management,Ndhivuwo Mphephu | Romeo Taljaard," The Forestry and Agricultural sectors are key to the economy in South Africa, and development in Africa. The biggest threats to the potential growth of these industries are climate change and introduced pests and diseases. The Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI) and its research partner, the ICFR, are at the forefront of helping the SA forestry and agriculture industries and related government departments to develop leading, appropriate technologies to address issues such issues. These institutes have an increasing need to more optimally integrate data from across these fields such as planting stock, pests and diseases with the weather, soil and other data. In this project, we would like to unlock the understanding of 70 years of weather data to serve as a basis for gaining insight into the data. The objective is to create a Web based App to host this dataset where potential users can visit the App to preform exploratory data analysis and also the predictive analytics. In addition the user will be able to download the data based on the selection." ,DeepSynergy,exhibition,3
Fnz4iWXiMag, Forecasting Covid-19 cases using machine learning models in South Africa, Sakhiwo Mtwenka|Siyabonga Mbomambi,"The Corona virus (Covid â€“ 19) continues to have a significant negative impact on the wellbeing of humanity and the economy of many countries, more especially in emerging market economies. the LSTM and the Facebook Prophet sequential models were trained on Google term searches and South African Covid - 19 positive cases data. The LSTM achieved better overall accuraly relatively.",TeamNova,exhibition,4
tDcehQZ38dg,COVID-19 South Africa (COVID19ZA) Consortium,Yolanda Nkalashe | Andani Madodonga,"During a pandemic health and government officials are not just dealing with the effects of the pandemic itself but are also dealing with an infodemic as stated by the world health organization. This has a detrimental effect on how effective health and government plans to combat the virus. It has become a necessity for government and health officials to have risk communication strategies especially for the social media society. To assist with this, we have embarked on a project that will create a baseline for communication strategies for officials when communicating on social media. We use a microblog data, twitter, to assist in determining how information spreads through social media. We answer four questions 1. cluster South African vs international microblogs and perception between the clusters 2. If influential user will make microblog trend 3. What makes a microblog trend 4. Rate of transmission of a microblog.",AutoEncoders,exhibition,5
QI8kB9I3ctY, Using machine learning and Natural processing methods to extract text features for categorisation classification and detection,Raymond Chiruka|Motlhako Nakeng, "The covid19 pandemic saw an increase in health information that was shared on social media platforms. It is of importance  to public health institutions to analyze the trends of what information was is shared around public health on these platforms. The aim of this project was to analyze sentiments of English messages shared over twitter in particular reference to the Covid19 pandemic.",Condamics,exhibition,6
